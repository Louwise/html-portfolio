    <P>There are two choices of after-dinner drinks on the home run; Bourbon Amaro Cocktail. <br />
       Amaro is an Italian liquor that means "bitter" and it's typically served
       as an after-dinner <br />digestif. Don't worry though, it also has a hint of 
       warmth and sweetness that's perfect <br />with a cherry garnish.</P>
                               <h3>OR</h3>
    <p>Chocolate Martini. 
        Chocolate lovers, this drink is for you! The sweet dessert-like cocktail<br />
        is made with chocolate liquor, chocolate syrup, and chocolate shavingsâ€”<br />
        for good measure.</p>
